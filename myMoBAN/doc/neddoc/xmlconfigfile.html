<h2>XML File for MoBAN Configuration</h2>
<p>This XML file provides the configuration options for the MOBAN model. The parameters that might be set in this file are as follows.
<li> <b>Initial posture of the WBAN</b></li> optional</p>
<p><li> <b>Initial position of the WBAN in the simulation area</b></li>optional</p>
<p><li> <b>Duration range for the postures</b></li>(optional) A uniform random value is selected whenever a new stable posture is selected. If lower bound is equal to the upper
bound, the constant duration is always used. Note that the various length of different postures is implied in the Markov model which might be specified. This duration
determines the length of one state in the Markov Model.</p>
<p><li> <b>A list of Markov transition matrices</b></li> Any number of Markov transition matrices for posture selection can be separately defined. If no matrix is given,
a uniform random strategy is used for posture selection. If posture selection is done in the same way with no spatial or temporal correlation, just one matrix is 
enough. </p>
<p>In the case that spatial or time correlation is required, several matrices can be defined among which one should have the Attribute 'type' with value "default". 
The default matrix is firstly used for the positions or time instances that no specific matrix is set. Moreover, there is the possibility that a steady state is defined 
instead of specifying the whole Markov transition matrix. In this case, MoBAN extract the closest Markov model to the default matrix which satisfies
the given steady vector. This is considered as a simpler way of assigning different posture patterns for different time and space domains.</p>
<p>Note that each markovMatrix in the input xml file should be either a square matrix with dimensions equal to the number of postures, or a vector with the 
number of elements equal to the number of postures (steady state vector). It is clear that the default matrix cannot be a steady state vector and should be
a square matrix.  </p>
<p>A unique name should be given to each matrix, which will be used for specifying the matrix for particular time or area domain.</p>
<p><li> <b>A list of area types</b></li>. It is necessary, if spatial correlation is required for posture selection. If so, any number of area type can be defined each with a unique name.
For each area type, a set of area boundaries can be set that determine the part of the simulation area that is of that area type. At the moment, just rectangular parts are supported.</p>
<p><li> <b>A list of time domains</b></li>. It is necessary, if temporal correlation is required for posture selection. If so, any number of time domains can be defined each with a unique name.
For each time domain, a set of time boundaries can be set that determine the time durations of the whole simulation run of that time domain. </p>
<p><li> <b>A list of space nad/or time combinations</b></li>. Using this tag in the XML file, we specify which matrix should be used for 
each combination of the space and/or time. If in a combination, no time is specified, it means that it is the case for the whole simulation time. The</p>
